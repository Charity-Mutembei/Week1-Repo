        <p> On many days, I prefer being in silence and not much talks, if there is to be any. Regardless, it is the nature of men, I included, to talk without regarding what others might need or demand of whether they communicate or not. Even so, I doubt there is anyone with that much luxury. Freedom is however of essence and living alone might help some while others cannot and are disadvantaged.
            For me, the idea of adventure excites me. Mostly because of the drives involved, or even train rides, the exploration and being away from a family setting that seems to be full of conflict once too often. Probably, that is the same reason as to why I do appreciate writing as a way of venting and finding solace away from conflict and incomprehendable arguments that couples seem to have. 
            Recently, while trying to avoid the outside world as much as possible, i discovered knitting and it has grown into something that I enjoy. The thought of having different clothes that are personally made feels like having a super-power. That is where favor is earned making it one of the things in my favorite things. Along with it, it drawing. 
            Recently, I have been having a mind of trying painting as a way of spending leisure and the thought itself is exciting. 
            Cars too can be considered a favorite thing even though the irony exists in that I dont know how to drive and neither do i know hoow much about car parts. It is in the thrill of movement such as in safari rallies, I find favor for the automobiles.
